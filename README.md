# Malware Analysis Tool-

This is a project I started at the beginning of  2019. This is my capstone project subject (CSE-439) guided and mentored by Mr. Gagandeep Singh Sir
Since then it has gone from a console application to an "acceptable" GUI. 
This Malware script is signature based ,so it it is able to capture all kind of malware of signatured based . I might add some more heuristics function .
As it includes many signatures to safely get computer threats such as viruses, trojan horses, etc., the signatures that the AV uses come from VirusShare (https://virusshare.com/). I know that on their about-page it says, that scraping the website won't be tolerated, so I will not be responsible for the actions you perform with the software I made. I suggest to you that you look in your browser yourself to check if new Hash files were uploaded, and if you should not do it, the script is going to check, whether you have to download new ones/if new ones are available and you have not downloaded them so far. (Please do not penetrate my rectal hole Mr. VirusShare!!!)

Regarding what I just mentioned, if it should be a problem I will look into getting a server to make them available from there and as long as the problem exists and a server is not made available on my side I will take the program down (both crawler and Antivirus).
